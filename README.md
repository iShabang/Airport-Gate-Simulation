# Airport-Gate-Simulation

Simple simulation used to determine the minimum number of airport gates required to keep the airport conflict free for 24 hours. An initial schedule is provided, however the delays are randomized. A custom stack is used to keep track of the available gates. Once there are more flights than gates, the application returns the final time and terminates. 

What I learned
 - Design and implement a heap data structure
 - Debug data structure logic errors
 - Implement sorting for custom objects
